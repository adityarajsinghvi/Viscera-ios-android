# Viscera-ios-android

This is 4th semester project of Aditya Raj Singhvi, Aman Maheshwari and Yash rajpal, of Course Social Information and Networking.
This is a basic Health monitor app developed for a startup named Viscera.

We have used React-Native for cross platform app development and this app is available on android playstore and ios appstore.

For Backend we have used pre-existing firebase services from their previous app.

Thank You!
